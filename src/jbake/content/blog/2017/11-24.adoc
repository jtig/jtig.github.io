Welcome to my new website!

This is my first attempt at creating and maintaining my own site on its own domain.  I started simple with JBake, and deploy to
GitHub Pages through Travis CI.  To get the site working with ssl I created a Cloudflare account and updated the dns settings on my
domain to go through Cloudflare.

I've owned this domain for a few months and am finally getting around to building a site.  I thought it would be fun to document the
process I'm taking to work on my next talk at DevNexus in 2018.
